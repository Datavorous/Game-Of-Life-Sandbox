## Controls
As it's having no GUI at present, everything depends upon key presses and key combinations
<br>Here's the list: 
* ```Space``` : pauses/plays
* ```Left mouse button``` : places an alive cell in the grid
* ```Right mouse button``` : makes an alive cell dead in the grid
* ```Enter``` : kills all the cells in the grid
* ```f``` with ```l``` : decreases fps to 1/2 times of the current fps
* ```f``` with ```h``` : increases fps to 2 times of the current fps 
* ```c``` : toggles between 6 color themes
* ```r``` : randomly distribute alive cells in the grid
* ```i``` : shows info
* ```g``` : draws grid lines
* ```z``` : draws two red lines to indicate the centre of the grid
